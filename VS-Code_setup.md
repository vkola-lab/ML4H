# Setting up the basics
## Virtual Studio Code (VS Code)
This document will help you install and setup the application VS Code and necessary utilities to smoothly run python and 
smoothly train machine learning models. Let's get started!

### Step-1: Download and Install VS Code
1.  Visit the [official VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2.  Download and install the version appropriate for your operating system.

5.  Double-click on the application. This will pop up a small window asking for permission if you want to open the application. There is nothing to worry about this. Go ahead and click Open.

Now, that we have the search box we can start setting up our application for some machine learning codes. To get started, install the following extensions:

1.  ****Python****: Provides Python language support. Make sure you install the &ldquo;microsoft.com&rdquo; version of the extension as shown below:

2.  ****Jupyter****: Enables working with Jupyter Notebooks. Once installed it should look like something like this:
    ![img](./assets/images/vscode_jupyter.png)

Perfect! Now we have our setup ready.

### Step-3: Set up a coding directory
1.  Open VS Code and press Ctrl+` (The key present in the left top corner just below the Esc key)
2.  This will open a new terminal. Create a directory called "ml4h" by typing the following command
    ```
    mkdir ml4h
    cd ml4h
    ```

## Great Work! We now have all items ready (1) VS Code platform to code, (2) ml4h directory to keep all codes safe.
